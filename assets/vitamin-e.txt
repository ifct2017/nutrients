Vitamin E in food is presented as tocopherols and tocotrienols and its isomers. The new Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin E (Krinsky, 2000) has stated that with the exception of Î±-tocopherol all other individual isomers of tocopherols and tocotrienols do not contribute to vitamin E activity, nevertheless, they are included in the database.
