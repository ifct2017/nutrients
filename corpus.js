Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3 in animal source foods including 25 hydroxy-D3 measured by LC-MS/MS has also been reported. The availability of new analytical vitamin D data in foods will permit dietary intake assessment. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) made commercially has been reported to have the similar potency in human. Total vitamin D activity has been taken as the sum of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and five times 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25-hydroxy cholecalciferol), where data are available.\n"}],
